# Email_data_Extraction
The code within this repo shows how I have extracted all emails from a particular label in that gmail account.
This code for extraction of all the mails under a particular label is mentioned in the code.py file.
All the mails will be downloaded and stored in the format of .eml files.
Use these .eml files for further data extraction.

There is a sample eml file I have put in this repo of what I have extracted.Apparently I had to extract data from html .eml file.
So that is why in extraction python file i had to include ,if html/text file then open for reading to data extract.

All the data I had to extract from all the mails were of a particular format, this allowed me to select the line from which I could extract the data.

This is a sample mail whose data I was able to extract......
